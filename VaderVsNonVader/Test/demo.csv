review
I love yelp they totally got this right ! I wanted true athuntic southern hospitality and I got it . The staff was all smiling. The hostess was engaging and totally legit asking questions about me and my trip down south. Samantha Ibew the grocer and butcher and candle stick maker that delivers to this slice of heaven. Juanita gave me huge smile and gentle hug and welcomed me I was truly impressed.  Genuine pleasant and kind  Then came the pancakes I heard about and they delivered  Two plate sized with hot syrup and butter ( I asked for more butter bcuz these beasts were huge ) and scrambled eggs and cheez and strips of bacon that crossed the dish ! I can taste Sysco food &amp; EVERYTHING here was fresh from neighborhood. The main dining room was full and NOT insane loud at all. They had covered outside tables too and a bar.
"We came here Easter Sunday, the wife and the her family, and I commend them for their customer service. They normally don't take reservations (it's popular enough), but they made an exception for my wife, who had ankle surgery and could not stand around (not enough chairs to wait in), so they took our ""reservation"" I was suggested to try the chicken biscuit sandwich, so I ordered that. The wife ordered the fried chicken and waffles, not a typical breakfast item for me since I am not from the south, but both of them were very good. The biscuit was hard outside, and soft on the inside. The chicken on both entrees tasted fresh and crisp. My favorite part of the chicken biscuit was the red pepper jam. It was delectable; a touch of sweet and tangy. Overall the experience was pleasant and the food was good. As far as value proposition, I am not sure, since we were treated.  The whole time we were there it was packed and people were waiting when we left. Note: their parking area is the worst part of the restaurant. They have a GIANT dip that will scratch and bump any low riding car, and it was very muddy that Sunday."
"Had a late breakfast on Friday morning recently. There was no wait and plenty of parking.   The omelette with pimento cheese, Benton's Bacon and red pepper jelly was pretty amazing. The way the savory, salty and sweet flavors worked together just kind of make you happy.I chose the potato as my side, which was kind of interesting. It was basically half of a potato flash-fried and served with shoestring onions on top. Not really special itself but really served well as a starch with the omelette. On the other hand, the biscuit that came with the omelette was amazing. It was really more like a scone and was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The fresh blueberry compote/jam that came with it was a nice complement.   We ordered a large french press which was supposed to serve 3-4 but only got one cup out of it. After discussing with our server, another came to the table that could have served three people. This was an inconvenience but in no way a meal breaker.  Highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area."
"The first time I came here was on a Sunday around 1 (peak brunch time) so I expected a wait. We were told an hour but it was more like an hour and a half.   Fortunately, the long wait gave me time to work through my commitment issues and I was able to order immediately upon sitting down. The food came out quickly (ten minutes or less). I didn't realize how massive the biscuits and general portion sizes were. Certainly not complaining. The biscuits were very good as was the pimiento cheese. I loved the pancakes I got (nice and fluffy).  On my second visit (Saturday at 11) the 1-hour estimate was again more like an hour and a half, a little over actually. This time I tried their pimiento cheese omelette and it did not disappoint. The savory sweet combo of the bacon, pimiento cheese, and red pepper jelly was delicious.  It's a cute mom and pop style restaurant that looks like it's inside someone's house. The food tastes like it too. Someone's grandma has got to be back there consulting on those biscuits. Service was good. They were busy but our server, Ashlee, I believe was still friendly and calm. Parking is tight but on the weekends you do have several options. I ended up parking in the Art Gallery next door my first time there and across the street at Chase on my second visit. They have a sign up outside of their restaurant telling you where you can park. You can also call and ask them.   If you have any biscuit loving friends bring them here. A word to the wise though if you get here after 1:30 during the weekend and you want to be seated at a table rather than the bar, you may be too late. They close at 3 and at some point they stop adding names to the list because it would take them past their 3pm closing time. The bar is first come first serve though so if someone leaves you can take their spot and order. There will be other vultures circling for the kill though so be forewarned."
My husband and I came here on a Wednesday for lunch we find a spot right in front of the restaurant they have additional parking at the back. It was not too crowded so we got seated right away. I chose the patio because the table inside that the waitress put us to sit down was dirty they did not clean it off. I chose the patio which was really nice because the weather was beautiful outside. We ordered two almond milk cold brew drinks and chicken biscuit with the BLT sandwich and a side of fries everything was delicious.We got our food pretty quick since it was not a lot of people there. I really like their biscuit I was going to order some to bring home but I didn't. On a diet. Great Customer service!
"I guess we really wanted to eat here. 1:45 min wait. We ordered a biscuit and apple brioche with coffee while waiting. It was a Saturday noon. When we finally sat down we wanted to order everything on the menu. Vegans be gone!!! We ordered the waffle burger and the fried chicken biscuit. Large portions. All the meals sent our cholesterol through the roof but that's what you'll get down here. We wanted to try other dishes so we'll have to come back. Friendly staff, charming spot."
"Simple. Delicious. Probably my favorite breakfast anywhere. The biscuits are the star attraction. Fresh, with that perfect crisp on the outside and that soft delicious rich buttermilk interior.   Done as a sandwich, the crispy chicken is a great place to start. Served with pickles and a pepper jelly. You will not have a better one anywhere.  I ordered the BK breakfast... Built around a biscuit, I added think cut bacon, and a crispy potato. It was served with a tart blueberry jam.   You may have a bit of a wait, but it's totally worth it. Grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the rustic farmhouse feel and the friendly patrons."
"From the looks of the crowd standing outside in 30 degree weather, this place must be legit! No parking and a 40 minute wait at 9:30am on a Saturday morning...so prepare yourselves people! We came at the peak time obviously. There's not a large waiting area inside (lots of us were bumping in to each other), so most people hang out on the porch. Yet is really is a diverse and trendy place to gather for breakfast. Nothing fancy in terms of decor, but great food, vibes, and an amazing staff.   Ordered the homemade biscuit, croissant (the chocolate was featured), and created my own plate with several sides...chicken sausage, fried potatoes, and sautéed kale. The highlight was definitely the kale, it was simply tossed in oil with sea salt but delish! The fried potato is a new fav for me...a potato halved, then fried and topped with fried onions. Yum! Chicken sausage was juicy and served in 3. Each side/item was about $4. They had a lobster omelette I wanted to try ($18), it looked fluffy and like a lot of food with the side.   Overall It was a wonderful breakfast and occasionally I don't mind branching out for a new experience. However, when I'm ready for breakfast first thing in the morning I probably wouldn't wait this long each time."
"Good place to come during the week. On the weekends it's a bit crowded and hectic. No place to park. Service is a bit slow, especially for a week day. Food is still pretty good! What I wanted to try I was told that they only serve the roast beef hash on weekends, which I understand is one of their signature dishes. I had the chicken biscuit which was very pleasing. They could have been a bit fluffier, but very tasty. I will think about going back for the hash, not sure the wait for parking would be worth it."
This is a delightful place that we learned about on DDD. We can confirm the pancakes and biscuits are excellent. Same for the coffee. Our short wait was exactly what we were told it would be. Arrived Saturday about 8:20 am. Waited 15 minutes. By the time we were seated we overheard the wait was over 30 minutes. Parking is difficult but they have a sign that tells you where you can park. Will go again.
"Server, Evan, was nice &amp; nostalgic with proper menu knowledge.  Grapefruit juice for breakfast is one of my all time favorites.  They are closed on Mondays so beware.  They have a petite menu, but everything seems to be picked for perfection. It is a close knit building, but there is parking available all around.  Fried Green Tomato Melt was cheesy &amp; tasty.  Tossed farm greens was great; it had a nice vinaigrette. I'll try to swing by again when I'm in town."
"This place is amazing! After I went here I actually ended up seeing it on an episode of Diners, Drives, and Dive Ins. If anywhere in Atlanta is worthy of being on that show, it's this place! Don't be intimidated by the wait!   As far as food goes, I highly recommend trying their signature chicken biscuit on your first trip. You can't go wrong with their menu, but this is truly their staple. In terms of service, the waiters are incredibly nice and make great food suggestions. This is a must-try while in Atlanta!"
"So Buttermilk Kitchen has flown under my radar for apparently years. In fact, I was in the car for a ride one Sunday morning and had no idea we were going until I found myself in the parking lot.   20 minutes before opening, the lot was almost full and there was a line waiting outside so yea, get here EARLY. We have gone twice now in the last month and our wait time the second time was only about 15 minutes for a party of two.   So what did we get in each trip?  Market Scramble (MP - Market price) Chicken biscuit ($14) Biscuit with jam ($3.5) Truffle potato (Included side)  Stone ground cheese grits (included side) Short stack of pancakes ($7.50) tea ($2.5) OJ ($2.5 )  Second visit  Short Rib Hash ($16) Biscuits and gravy ($10) One add on pancake Coffee x 2 ($2.5 x 2)  First visit   I was wowed by practically everything I tried. The biscuit was monstrous, came with three jams and it alone could be a meal. I enjoyed the crispy, buttery flavors here. Worth every penny.  The short stack of buttermilk pancakes smelled of vanilla and I enjoyed them, though for me they weren't anymore special than at other breakfast locations we've visited. My girlfriend loved them, and we both thought they weren't dense but could still fill you up.  The chicken biscuit was good, but I thought the actual chicken was dwarfed by the biscuit itself, and got lost in the biscuit flavors, so I wasn't that big of a fan.  The market Scramble for this day was a pine street chorizo mixed with scrambled eggs, Parmesan cheese, fried potato chunks and had a blob of sour cream on top. Here's the thing, on paper this dish should've blown me away, but in fact I didn't finish it. I didn't like the flavors of the chorizo, and I barely tasted the cheese. For the price, which is their market price (mine was about 18 bucks or so), I came away thinking I should've ordered something else.  Cheese grits were solid, I loved the Truffle potato, which is crispy and covered in pimento cheese that really made this thing pop for me.   Second visit   Something interesting happened on our second visit...namely both of our entrees were luke warm upon delivery at best, and we had to send them back to be reheated, which were done with several apologies.  Biscuits and gravy were not finished because the gravy had more of a sweet flavor than traditional gravy. This was not my dish but it wasn't finished.   The Short rib hash (my dish) came with 2 eggs, yum yum sauce, cilantro, pickled peppers and crispy potato with of course, short rib. Really great dish that didn't last long at all on my plate. No one flavor stood out as odd and it all married together nicely. Highly recommended.  Customer service for each visit was nice, although we waited much longer for our server to check on us the second visit. Not terrible, but not consistent.   Parking can be an issue if you aren't here 20 minutes early. In fact we parked next door at Mirko's and walked over when we weren't able to find parking, so you've been warned.  Is Buttermilk kitchen a 5 star restaurant? Considering all the reviews and star count, you'd think they were close. They get a lot of things right, but they also need work on some things as well. We have and will go back on occasion, because we have generally enjoyed ourselves here. We're just looking for a little bit better. Maybe next time!"
Love this place! Although I wish they would do reservations because it is so popular! The lemonade is homemade and delicious and the biscuits are as big as your hand! I got the short rib hash with a biscuit and it was DELICIOUS! The special BK sauce was amazing. I highly recommend this brunch place!
"This is probably one of the best brunch places I've been to in Atlanta. Their Pimento Omelet and Chicken &amp; Waffles are must-haves. If you're going on a weekend, especially a Sunday, be prepared to wait for around half an hour for your table. I love their decor and coffee, reminds me of a cafe in Cape Cod!"
"On my way to my culinary world's exploration I stopped for another Southern spot (one of my favorite kind of cuisine). Atlanta is known for that and you want to hear about that Buttermilk Kitchen spot.  Waiting is a little long but the waitress was friendly and she gave us lemonade while waiting, anyway it was worth it.  I had the biggest Chicken Biscuit ever I was not even able to finish my plate. Tried the sweet potato and fried green tomato which was my very first and I am in loooove. My friend ordered maple bacon with whisky syrup and cheese grits, I don't need to tell you how good this was...  The fresh squeezed orange juice came in handy since I was tired from my travels, bottomless coffee tasted right as well.  I strongly recommend this joint, you might see me there again!"
"One of the best breakfasts I have had in ATL! Buttermilk Kitchen's is simply everything you want in a good breakfast spot homey, busy, comforting and just plain good! The staff and service were great, things moved along quicker than expected especially with seeing how packed the restaurant was. I got their Chicken Biscuit which was so so good. You would think the chicken or the biscuit would be the star and don't get me wrong they were both great but the PEPPER JELLY, my goodness.. it steals the show, it's one of those things you never knew you needed. We all loved our food and drinks. Parking is tricky see the picture for tips, be patience it's worth it!"
Nice place. Casual but trendy. Not really any healthy or plant based options but a great place to splurge or just give up lol Short rib hash is tasty (a little too salty) but overall yummy. The French toast &amp; bacon were excellent.  Polite &amp; friendly service.   I feel like all egg or meat based dishes should come with a biscuit or toast for what you pay.
"I absolutely LOVED this place. Went in on a Sunday at around 11am. First tip: dont come here hungry. Expect a wait. We signed up and they said it would be 30-50min so we decided to go to a small mall nearby! 20min into the wait I called and they said we were next. I was very pleased with the fact that they were good/reliable with their wait times. I ordered the Chicken Biscuit and my friend ordered the Pimento cheese omelet. I tried her omelet so I could comment on both dishes. Both were phenomenal. Great presentation, great quantity, amazing taste and very little wait once we ordered. I loved the ambiance and we stayed there for a good hour after we finished eating just chatting. I cant wait for a beautiful Sunny Spring day to go and sit outside and enjoy a life changing meal here. Highly recommend"
"First day visiting my friend in the Atlanta area so was checking Yelp for some brunch options and decided to go with this one. When arriving the parking lot was full (pretty small) so we drove around for parking, but after a little bit there was a space open in the lot. Walking in the space was a lot larger than it looks. I got the French toast with fruit compote and the Milky Way cold brew. The cold brew was amazing so I would definitely recommend this if you do not mind vanilla and milk in your cold brew. The French toast was pretty good if you like eating sweets for brunch, otherwise I would recommend the chicken biscuit because the flavors were so unique! Our waitress was very nice and I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. If I get the chance, then I would definitely come back here and try some other options."

I got the French toast with fruit compote and the Milky Way cold brew. The cold brew was amazing so I would definitely recommend this if you do not mind vanilla and milk in your cold brew. The French toast was pretty good if you like eating sweets for brunch, otherwise I would recommend the chicken biscuit because the flavors were so unique! Our waitress was very nice and I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. If I get the chance, then I would definitely come back here and try some other options."
